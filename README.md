# Barebones http
this repo is a simple implementation of HTTP/1.1.
the code can be run by typing `v run .` in your terminal with the cloned repo as the working directory,
if you want to run it on a specific port or not as localhost type `v run . :(your port)`, there needs 
to be a colon before the port number, if you want to serve on localhost just type `v run . localhost:(your port)`
